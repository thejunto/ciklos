title: Echor Gem for Ruby contains a flaw
date: 2014-01-14
description: Echor Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in backplane.rb in the perform_request function that is triggered when
  a semi-colon (;) is injected into a username or password. This may allow a context-dependent attacker to inject
  arbitrary commands if the gem is used in a rails application.
